# TFM

For this Github, we include the code for the TFM “Communication vs. Polarization: A network analysis of science communication in Twitter” by Roberto Rey Siero, Iñaki Úcar Marqués and Lucas Sánchez Sampedro.
The datasets could not be uploaded because of the Githaub uploading limit.
If you require any of the datasets used, feel free to contact me at robertoreysiero@gmail.com
